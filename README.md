# 475_web_data

This is a static holder for json and image data for CPSC475, if you can see this data on the web then your app should also be able to see it.<br>

To get a link to access the raw <b>editable</b> files (like pets.json), just select the file of interest and then click the 'raw' button.  This will give a link to just that file, like so;<br>

<br>
To get a link to the .png images, just strip pets.json from above link and add the image png file, like so;<br>
